          I was born in Lom√©, Togo (which is west of Africa), and grew up in Sheffield, United Kingdom. 
          I enjoy lifting weights, watching anime, Netflix, discovering new restaurants, swimming, and singing.

          I got into web development because I wanted a career change. I started on my own with FreeCodeCamp and,
           fortunately, stumbled across a rigorous bootcamp that taught me so much. It's been over a year of being in web development. 
          I've seen and met so many amazing people. I cannot wait for what the future holds!
